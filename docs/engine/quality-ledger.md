# Quality ledger

Every place the native engine deliberately renders differently from today's app because
today's output is measurably wrong (QUALITY-1, QUALITY-2, [gate-policy.md](gate-policy.md)).
Authored intent never changes here. A row records a correction, the standard it follows,
and the proof.

## Row format

One section per area (for example `## Video`, `## Text raster`). Each section states once:

- **Reference:** how the f64 or supersampled reference is computed and the standard it
  follows (for example "H.273 and BT.2100 in f64", "exact coverage, 16 × 16 cells",
  "W3C Compositing and Blending §10 in E").
- **Gate:** the test that proves the engine is at least as close as today.
- **Units:** 8-bit display code values (CV) unless stated.

Then one row per correction:

| Correction (standard) | Today vs reference: max, p99.9, mean | Engine vs reference: max, p99.9, mean | Cases |
|---|---|---|---|

## Required evidence

- Both distances come from the row's gate, on the cases it names. Describe cases; never
  name private corpus projects.
- Before/after side-by-sides stay outside Git, in the lane's evidence directory, linked
  from the lane report.
- The corrected content renders the same in the preview and the export.
- A correctness fix needs no decision, even when it shifts every project's look. Only
  a correction where "correct" is genuinely ambiguous (no standard applies, or tags
  conflict) cites the orchestrator's decision.

Rewrite a row when its numbers change. Keep no round history here.

## 3D Library cards (C3)

- **Reference:** the engine's render of the same pinned view at 4× per axis (each
  sample 4× MSAA), box-averaged to card pixels in the card's encoding. It is the
  engine's own 8-bit render averaged in gamma space; the 3D lane's linear-light
  resolve should replace it with an independent f32 reference.
- **Gate:** `e2e/library-card-parity.spec.ts`, 3D cases. Pixels away from edges are
  exact. A differing edge pixel (3×3 span above 8 CV in today's card) must be, per
  channel, no further from the reference than today's.
- **Units:** CV, max channel difference, over the pixels where today and the engine
  differ.

| Correction (standard) | Today vs reference: max, p99.9, mean | Engine vs reference: max, p99.9, mean | Cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| MSAA edge resolve: Metal hardware resolve instead of WebGL's (box filter over samples) | 1, 1, 1.00 | 0, 0, 0.00 | Camera view, 4 viewers × 2 themes (35 edge pixels) |

Open, gate failing: in the Editor view, today is 20, 20, 5.02 and the engine is
19, 19, 4.65 (132 edge pixels, 16 cards), but 4–5 pixels per card are one CV
further from the reference than today's. Owner: 3D lane (linear-light resolve).
The raw camera frame's one interior pixel, `(799, 448)`, is a rounding-midpoint tie:
a surface fit over 2,805 face pixels gives 150.50 ± 0.02, and today (151) and the
engine (150) are both 0.50 away.
